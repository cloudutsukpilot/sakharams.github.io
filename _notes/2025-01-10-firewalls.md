## Introduction to Firewall
- A firewall is a network security system that controls and filters network traffic, acting as a watchman between a private network and the public Internet.

- They come in two broad categories:
    + Software-based: installed on individual devices for protection
    + Hardware-based: stand-alone devices that safeguard an entire network.

- Firewalls have several types, each designed for specific security needs:
1. `Packet Filtering Firewalls`: Examines packets of data, accepting or rejecting based on source, destination, or protocols.

2. `Circuit-level Gateways`: Monitors TCP handshake between packets to determine session legitimacy.

3. `Application-level Gateways (Proxy Firewalls)`: Filters incoming traffic between your network and traffic source, offering a protective shield against untrusted networks.

4. `Stateful Inspection Firewalls`: Tracks active connections to determine which packets to allow, analyzing in the context of their place in a data stream.

5. `Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs)`: Advanced firewalls that integrate traditional methods with functionalities like intrusion prevention systems, deep packet analysis, and application awareness.
