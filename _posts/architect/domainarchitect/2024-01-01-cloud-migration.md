## Cloud Migration

### Application Migration Checklist

1. **Assess Current Environment**
- Evaluate existing infrastructure, dependencies, and application performance to identify potential challenges and compatibility issues before migration.

2. **Define Migration Strategy**
- Choose an appropriate migration strategy (e.g., lift-and-shift, refactor, replatform) based on the application requirements and business goals.

3. **Backup Data**
- Ensure all critical data is backed up securely to avoid any loss during the migration process and to facilitate recovery if necessary.

4. **Plan Downtime**
- Schedule and communicate planned downtime to stakeholders, ensuring minimal disruption to users and business operations during the migration.

5. **Test Migration Process**
- Conduct thorough testing in a staging environment to validate that the migration process works as intended and that the application functions correctly post-migration.

6. **Monitor Post-Migration**
- After migration, monitor the application for performance, stability, and any issues to ensure it operates smoothly in the new environment.


### Database Migration Checklist

1. **Evaluate Current Database**
- Assess the current database structure, data types, and dependencies to identify potential challenges and ensure compatibility with the target environment.

2. **Select Migration Method**
- Choose the appropriate migration method (e.g., replication, ETL, backup-restore) based on data volume, complexity, and downtime tolerance.

3. **Backup Existing Data**
- Perform a complete backup of the current database to safeguard against data loss during the migration and enable a quick rollback if needed.

4. **Plan and Communicate Downtime**
- Schedule downtime for the migration, inform stakeholders, and ensure minimal disruption to operations during the migration process.

5. **Run Migration Tests**
- Conduct a dry run or test migration in a non-production environment to validate the process, ensuring data integrity and application functionality post-migration.

6. **Monitor and Optimize**
- After migration, closely monitor the database performance, check for any anomalies, and optimize queries or configurations as needed for the new environment.


### Migrations Needed After Company Acquisition

1. **Application Migration**
- Consolidate and integrate applications from both companies, ensuring compatibility and standardization across the merged organization.

2. **M365 Migration**
- Migrate Microsoft 365 services (e.g., email, SharePoint, Teams) to a unified tenant to streamline communication and collaboration.

3. **Database Migration**
- Merge, migrate, or consolidate databases, ensuring data integrity, consistency, and accessibility across the combined entity.

4. **Network Integration**
- Integrate and standardize network infrastructure, including VPNs, firewalls, and security protocols, to ensure secure and seamless connectivity.

5. **Identity and Access Management (IAM) Integration**
- Unify IAM systems to manage user identities, roles, and access permissions consistently across both organizations.

6. **Process Redefining**
- Align and redefine business processes, workflows, and policies to reflect the combined operations and achieve operational efficiency.

7. **Data Migration and Consolidation**
- Transfer, cleanse, and merge data from various sources, ensuring a single source of truth and consistent data governance across the organization.

8. **ERP/CRM System Migration**
- Consolidate or migrate ERP and CRM systems to maintain a unified view of financials, customer relationships, and supply chain operations.

9. **Security Policy Alignment**
- Harmonize cybersecurity policies and practices to protect against threats while maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.

10. **IT Service Integration**
- Integrate IT service management tools and practices to ensure seamless IT support and incident management across the new organization.


### M365 Migration Checklist

1. **Assess Current Environment**
- Evaluate the existing Microsoft 365 (M365) environment, including the number of users, mailboxes, applications, and data. 
- Identify potential challenges such as legacy systems, custom configurations, and compliance requirements.

2. **Define Migration Strategy**
- Choose a migration strategy based on the organization's needs, such as staged migration, cutover migration, or hybrid migration. 
- Determine whether a third-party tool is needed and create a detailed migration plan, including timelines and resource allocation.

3. **Prepare the Target Environment**
- Set up and configure the target M365 environment, ensuring that it meets the organizationâ€™s requirements.
- This includes setting up user accounts, permissions, security policies, and configuring services like Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Teams.

4. **Backup Existing Data**
- Ensure that all critical data, including emails, documents, and settings, are backed up before starting the migration. 
- This safeguards against data loss during the process and enables recovery if necessary.

5. **User Communication and Training**
- Communicate the migration plan, timelines, and impact to all users. 
- Provide necessary training and resources to help users transition smoothly to the new environment.

6. **Perform Pilot Migration**
- Conduct a pilot migration with a small group of users or a specific department to test the process. 
- Validate that data, configurations, and user access are correctly migrated. Identify and address any issues before full-scale migration.

7. **Execute Full Migration**
- Proceed with the migration of all users, mailboxes, applications, and data. 
- Monitor the process closely to ensure that it runs smoothly, and address any issues that arise during the migration.

8. **Post-Migration Validation**
- After migration, verify that all data and services are functioning as expected. 
- This includes checking email flow, document accessibility, permissions, and configurations. 
- Ensure that users have the necessary access and that there are no disruptions to their work.

9. **Decommission Legacy Systems**
- Once the migration is successful and all data is validated, decommission the legacy systems that are no longer needed. 
- Ensure that any necessary data or configurations are archived for future reference.

10. **Ongoing Support and Optimization**
- Provide ongoing support to users as they adapt to the new M365 environment. 
- Monitor performance, address any post-migration issues, and optimize the environment for better efficiency and security. 
- Conduct a post-migration review to identify areas for improvement in future migrations.
