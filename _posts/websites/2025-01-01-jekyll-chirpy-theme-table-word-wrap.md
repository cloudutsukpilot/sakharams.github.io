## Enabling Word Wrap in Tables in Jekyll Chirpy Theme

In this blog, weâ€™ll walk you through how to enable word wrapping in tables and ensure they adapt well to different screen sizes.

### Problem: Horizontal Scroll Bar in Tables

- By default, the Jekyll Chirpy theme might cause tables to display horizontal scroll bars when the content inside table cells is too long.
- This can be especially problematic for smaller screens, as users may have to scroll horizontally to view the full content of the table.

- To fix this, we can modify the table cell styles to ensure that content within the table wraps instead of overflowing.

### Solution 1: Enabling Word Wrap in Table Cells

- To solve this issue and enable word wrapping, you can override the default styles in the Chirpy theme by editing the `jekyll-theme-chirpy.scss` file in the `assets/css` directory.
- Follow the steps below to implement this solution:

- `Step 1`: Locate the jekyll-theme-chirpy.scss File(Create the file if it is not present - ./assets/css/jekyll-theme-chirpy.scss)
- `Step 2`: Modify the CSS to Enable Word Wrap. You will need to add or modify the following CSS rule in the jekyll-theme-chirpy.scss file:

```scss
%table-cell {
  white-space: normal;
}
```

- Below is the complete file content that I have used:

```scss
---

@import "main";

%table-cell {
    white-space: normal;
  }
```

- This CSS rule tells the browser to apply normal text wrapping behavior within the table cells.

- `Step 3`: Rebuild Your Jekyll Site. Once you've made these changes, save the jekyll-theme-chirpy.scss file and rebuild your Jekyll site. You can do this by running:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

- After rebuilding, check the tables in your site. The text inside the table cells should now automatically wrap based on the screen size, eliminating the need for horizontal scroll bars.
- Final Output:

### Solution 2: Enabling Word Wrap in Table Cells

- As we are using @import in the above solution, we get a warning "Sass @import rules are deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 3.0.0".
- To fix these warning, I have used the below code in the jekyll-theme-chirpy.scss file and it is working without any warnings on jekyll-theme-chirpy version 7.2.4.

```scss
---

{%- if jekyll.environment == 'production' -%}
@use "main.bundle";
{%- else -%}
@use "main";
{%- endif -%}

.table-wrapper>table thead th,
.table-wrapper>table tbody tr td {
    padding: .4rem 1rem;
    font-size: 95%;
    white-space: normal
}
```

### Conclusion

If you're working with tables that contain large blocks of text or dynamic content, enabling word wrap is a simple yet effective way to ensure your tables remain clean and responsive.
