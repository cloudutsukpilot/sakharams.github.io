## Enabling Word Wrap in Tables in Jekyll Chirpy Theme

In this blog, weâ€™ll walk you through how to enable word wrapping in tables and ensure they adapt well to different screen sizes.

### Problem: Horizontal Scroll Bar in Tables

- By default, the Jekyll Chirpy theme might cause tables to display horizontal scroll bars when the content inside table cells is too long.
- This can be especially problematic for smaller screens, as users may have to scroll horizontally to view the full content of the table.

- To fix this, we can modify the table cell styles to ensure that content within the table wraps instead of overflowing.

### Solution: Enabling Word Wrap in Table Cells

- To solve this issue and enable word wrapping, you can override the default styles in the Chirpy theme by editing the `jekyll-theme-chirpy.scss` file in the `assets/css` directory.
- Follow the steps below to implement this solution:

- `Step 1`: Locate the jekyll-theme-chirpy.scss File(Create the file if it is not present - ./assets/css/jekyll-theme-chirpy.scss)
- `Step 2`: Modify the CSS to Enable Word Wrap. You will need to add or modify the following CSS rule in the jekyll-theme-chirpy.scss file:

```scss
%table-cell {
  white-space: normal;
}
```

- Below is the complete file content that I have used:

```scss
---

@import "main";

%table-cell {
    white-space: normal;
  }
```

- This CSS rule tells the browser to apply normal text wrapping behavior within the table cells.

- `Step 3`: Rebuild Your Jekyll Site. Once you've made these changes, save the jekyll-theme-chirpy.scss file and rebuild your Jekyll site. You can do this by running:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

- After rebuilding, check the tables in your site. The text inside the table cells should now automatically wrap based on the screen size, eliminating the need for horizontal scroll bars.
- Final Output:
