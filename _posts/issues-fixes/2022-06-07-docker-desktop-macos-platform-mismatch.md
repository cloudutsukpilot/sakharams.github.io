### Problem

Received an error while running docker images on MacOS.

### Error:

The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8)

### Cause

The requested image was likely built for the Linux/amd64 platform, but the host platform where the Docker image is being executed is Linux/arm64/v8.

#### Solution

- To resolve this issue, you may need to obtain a version of the image that is compatible with the host platform, or update the host platform to match the platform for which the image was built.
- I was able to resolve the issue by enabling containerd in docker desktop:
- Steps:
    1. Open Docker Desktop
    2. Go to 'Settings' -> General
    3. Enable `Use containerd for pulling and storing images`
