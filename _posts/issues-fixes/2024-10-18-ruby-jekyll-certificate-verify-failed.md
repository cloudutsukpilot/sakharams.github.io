## Error Messages

- ERROR: SSL verification error at depth 2: unable to get local issuer certificate (20)
- ERROR: You must add certificate to your local trusted store
- ERROR: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed

### System Configuration

- Operating System: MacOS
- Version: 14.3
- Name: Darwin


### What steps resulted in this error?

1. Installing the Jekyll static site generator using gem:

    ```bash
    gem install jekyll
    ```

2. Upgrading RubyGems using the self-update command:

    ```bash
    gem update --system
    ```

### What does this error mean?

- This error means that your machine was unable to establish a secure connection to RubyGems.org over SSL.

### Why did this error occur?

- The openssl installed on the machine did not trust the Zscalar certificate which was installed on the machine.

### Solution

- For openssl to trust the Zscalar certificate, we need to add the cert to its trusted folder.
- We can identify the path of the openssl certs fodler and the copy the certificate:

    ```bash
    openssl version -d
    cp /<path-to-cert>/cert.pen /opt/homebrew/etc/openssl@3/certs
    ```
