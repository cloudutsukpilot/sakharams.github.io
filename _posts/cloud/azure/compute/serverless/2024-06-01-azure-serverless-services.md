##  Azure Serverless:
- Azure Serverless refers to a cloud computing model offered by Microsoft Azure, where you can build and deploy applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. 
- In a serverless environment, you focus solely on your code, and Azure automatically handles the provisioning, scaling, and management of servers and resources.

### Key Aspects

1. Event-Driven
2. No Server Management
3. Automatic Scaling
4. Pay-as-you-go Pricing
5. Stateless
6. Focus on Business Logic

- It supports both publish-subscribe and message queueing patterns, making it suitable for building decoupled and scalable architectures.

5. `Azure Notification Hubs`
Azure Notification Hubs is a push notification service that helps you send personalized notifications to mobile devices, web browsers, and other platforms. 
- It provides features like audience segmentation, message tagging, and template-based notifications.

6. `Azure Durable Functions`
- Azure Durable Functions is an extension of Azure Functions that allows you to write stateful and long-running workflows. 
- It provides a programming model for building complex orchestrations and coordinating multiple function invocations.

7. `Azure API Management`
- Azure API Management is a fully managed service that helps you publish, secure, and manage APIs at scale. 
- It provides features like authentication, rate limiting, caching, and analytics to ensure the reliability and performance of your APIs.

8.  `Azure App Service`
- Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web applications. 
- It supports multiple programming languages and frameworks, and provides features like automatic scaling, continuous deployment, and integration with other Azure services.

9. `Azure Static Web Apps`
- Azure Static Web Apps is a service that enables you to build and deploy modern web applications quickly. 
- It integrates with GitHub to automatically build and deploy your app whenever you push changes to your repository.

### Storage
1. `Azure Cosmos DB`
- Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service. 
- It provides support for various data models, including document, key-value, graph, and columnar, and offers guaranteed low latency and high availability.

2. `Azure Storage`
- Azure Storage is a scalable and durable cloud storage service.
