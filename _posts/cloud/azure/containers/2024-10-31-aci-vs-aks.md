## Comparison

| Category | Azure Container Instances | Azure Kubernetes Service |
| -------- | -------------------------| ------------------------- |
| Definition | ACI is a serverless compute service that allows you to run containers <br> without managing the underlying infrastructure |  AKS provides a managed Kubernetes cluster |
| Use Case | Ideal for short-lived tasks or burst workloads | Suited for long-running applications and orchestrating containerized workloads |
| Billing Model | Billed per second, based on vCPU and memory usage | Billed for the VM nodes in the cluster (VM size, number of nodes) |
| Cost Factors | `Compute`: Pay only when containers are running <br> `Storage`: No persistent storage costs <br> `Networking`: Minimal networking costs | `Compute`: Ongoing cost for VM nodes <br> `Storage`: Persistent storage costs (Azure Disks, Azure Files, etc.) <br> `Networking`: Load balancer, egress traffic, etc. |
| Scalability | Scales automatically based on demand | Manual/Automated scaling of VM nodes |
| Management Overhead | Minimal management; serverless | Requires more management (upgrades, scaling, monitoring) |
| Advanced Features | Limited features (no orchestration, auto-scaling) | Rich Kubernetes features (auto-scaling, secrets management, RBAC) |
| Usage | ACI can be used together with plain Kubernetes or AKS | AKS is a individual free managed service |
| Cost example <br> for a containerized <br> web app |  Costs depend on the duration of container execution | Costs include VM nodes, storage, and networking |
