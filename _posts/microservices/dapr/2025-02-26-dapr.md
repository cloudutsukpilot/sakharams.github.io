## Introduction

Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) is an open-source runtime that simplifies the development of microservices by providing built-in best practices for building distributed applications. It abstracts common concerns like state management, service-to-service communication, pub/sub messaging, and observability, making it easier to develop scalable and resilient applications.

### Features/Building Blocks of Dapr

- Dapr offers several key features that enhance microservices development:

- `Service-to-service invocation`: Provides reliable service-to-service communication via HTTP and gRPC.
- `State Management`: Enables state persistence across different backends like Redis, Cosmos DB, and SQL databases.
- `Publish & Subscribe Messaging`: Allows event-driven communication between microservices using message brokers like Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Azure Service Bus.
- `Bindings & Triggers`: Connects external systems like databases, cloud services, and storage with event-driven triggers.
- `Observability`: Offers built-in tracing, logging, and metrics collection for monitoring distributed applications.
- `Secrets Management`: Helps securely manage and access application secrets from providers like Azure Key Vault and HashiCorp Vault.
- `Actors Model`: Implements the actor pattern for building stateful, distributed applications.
- `Configuration Management` – Centralizes and manages configurations across microservices.
- `Workflows` – Enables defining workflows to coordinate multiple services.
- `Distributed lock` - The distributed lock API enables your application to acquire a lock for any resource that gives it exclusive access until either the lock is released by the application, or a lease timeout occurs.
- `Cryptography` - The cryptography API provides an abstraction layer on top of security infrastructure such as key vaults. It contains APIs that allow you to perform cryptographic operations, such as encrypting and decrypting messages, without exposing keys to your applications.
- `Jobs` - The jobs API enables you to schedule jobs at specific times or intervals

### Dapr Core Components

1. `CLI (Command Line Interface)`
    - Used to interact with Dapr for local development, deployment, and debugging.
    - Commands include dapr run, dapr list, dapr stop, dapr uninstall, etc.
    - Helps developers quickly start and test applications with Dapr.

2. `API`
    - The Dapr sidecar exposes an API that allows applications to interact with Dapr functionalities.
    - Supports HTTP and gRPC-based communication.
    - Provides APIs for service invocation, state management, pub/sub, secrets, and more.

3. `Runtime`
    - The core engine of Dapr that runs as a sidecar next to each application.
    - Handles API calls, component interactions, and manages service-to-service communication.
    - Ensures reliability and security of microservices.

4. `Host`
    - The environment where Dapr runs, such as Kubernetes, self-hosted mode, or cloud infrastructure.
    - Determines how Dapr interacts with the underlying infrastructure.

5. `Sentry`
    - The certificate authority (CA) responsible for securing service-to-service communication.
    - Issues and manages mTLS certificates for authentication and encryption.
    - Ensures services communicate securely.

6. `Placement Service`
    - Manages the placement of Dapr Actors across a distributed system.
    - Ensures actors are properly registered, discovered, and distributed across nodes.
    - Necessary for applications using the actor model.

7. `Injector`
    - A Kubernetes admission webhook responsible for injecting Dapr sidecars into pods.
    - Ensures that each application pod gets a Dapr runtime instance automatically.
    - Simplifies integration of Dapr with Kubernetes workloads.

8. `Operator`
    - Manages Dapr components in Kubernetes environments.
    - Handles configuration, component updates, and lifecycle management.
    - Ensures smooth operations within a Kubernetes cluster.

### When to Use Dapr

- Dapr is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

1. `Building Cloud-Native Applications`: Simplifies cloud development by handling common distributed system challenges.
2. `Microservices Communication`: Facilitates reliable and secure service-to-service communication.
3. `Event-Driven Architectures`: Enables seamless event-driven workflows and pub/sub messaging.
4. `Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Deployments`: Works across different cloud providers and on-prem environments.
5. `Stateful Workloads`: Implements state management efficiently using different storage backends.

### Benefits of Dapr

- Using Dapr provides several advantages:

1. `Simplified Development`: Reduces complexity by abstracting common microservices patterns.
2. `Portability`: Works across multiple environments, including Kubernetes, VMs, and edge devices.
3. `Interoperability`: Supports multiple programming languages and runtimes.
4. `Scalability`: Easily scales microservices based on demand.
5. `Built-in Security`: Secure service communications and secrets management.

### Drawbacks of Dapr

- Despite its benefits, Dapr also has some challenges:

1. `Learning Curve`: Developers need to understand Dapr concepts and its building blocks.
2. `Operational Overhead`: Running a sidecar architecture can introduce additional resource consumption.
3. `Vendor Lock-in Concerns`: While open-source, heavy reliance on Dapr APIs may make switching architectures difficult.

### Dapr vs. Traditional Microservices Approach

| State Management     | Supported                 | External Datastore Needed     |
| Pub/Sub Messaging    | Out-of-the-box            | Custom Implementation         |
| Observability        | Built-in Tracing & Logging| Needs External Tools          |
| Secrets Management   | Built-in                  | External Provider Required    |

### Conclusion
