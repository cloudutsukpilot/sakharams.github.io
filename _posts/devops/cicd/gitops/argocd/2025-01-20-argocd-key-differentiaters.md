## ArgoCD - Key Differentiators

- Below are the key differentiators of ArgoCD:
  - ArgoCD Interactions
  - Scalability and High Availability
  - Security
  - Customization and Extensibility

### ArgoCD Interactions

- **User Interaction**
  - Users interact with ArgoCD primarily through the API server.
  - The CLI and the web Ul communicate with the API server for application management.

- **Git Interaction**
  - Repo Server interacts with Git repositories to fetch application configurations.
  - Supports various Git providers, including GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

### Scalability and High Availability

- **Horizontal Scaling**
  - ArgoCD components can be horizontally scaled for increased capacity.
  - API Server and Application Controller can be deployed with multiple replicas.

- **High Availability**
  - Deploying multiple instances of ArgoCD components ensures high availability.
  - Load balancing and redundancy contribute to a resilient architecture.

### Security

- **Authentication**
  - ArgoCD supports various authentication methods, including OIDC (OpenID Connect).
  - Dex can be integrated for external identity provider support.

- **Authorization**
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is employed for fine-grained access control.
  - Users are granted specific roles defining their permissions.

### Customization and Extensibility

- **Custom Resources**
  - ArgoCD extends Kubernetes with custom resource definitions (CRDs).
  - Custom resources enable the definition of additional application-related objects.
  
- **Plugins**
  - ArgoCD supports plugins for additional functionality.
  - Users can extend ArgoCD with custom tools and integrations.
