## Introduction

- Below are some of the command line tools used to interact with different container runtimes:

### 1. ctr

- `Description`:
  - A low-level CLI tool for managing containers in containerd.
  - Designed primarily for debugging and testing containerd functionality.
- `Key Features`:
  - Manage images, containers, snapshots, tasks, and namespaces.
  - Lightweight and directly interacts with the containerd API.
- `Pros`:
  - Minimal and fast for testing containerd internals.
  - Comprehensive control over containerd features.
- `Cons`:
  - Not user-friendly for typical container workflows (e.g., lacks Docker-like simplicity).
  - No built-in CRI support, so not ideal for Kubernetes users.
- `Common Use Cases`:
  - Debugging and low-level operations on containerd.

### 2. nerdctl

- `Description`:
  - A Docker-compatible CLI for containerd.
  - Aims to provide a Docker-like experience for containerd users.
- `Key Features`:
  - Supports OCI-compliant images, Compose files, and networking.
  - Compatible with Docker commands (nerdctl run, nerdctl build, etc.).
  - Supports rootless containers.
- `Pros`:
  - Familiar Docker-like syntax for easy adoption.
  - Adds usability layers over containerd without additional daemons.
  - Works seamlessly with Kubernetes setups using containerd.
- `Cons`:
  - Limited ecosystem compared to Docker.
  - May require configuration for advanced features like Compose.
- `Common Use Cases`:
  - Replacement for Docker CLI in containerd-based environments.

### 3. crictl

- `Description`:
  - A CLI tool specifically for interacting with Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI).
  - Supports runtimes like containerd, CRI-O, and others with CRI implementations.
- `Key Features`:
  - Debug pods, containers, and images in Kubernetes.
  - Inspect CRI operations like image pulls, container stats, and sandbox management.
  - Lightweight and runtime-agnostic.
- `Pros`:
  - Essential for debugging Kubernetes clusters.
  - Works across multiple CRI-compliant runtimes.
  - Simple and focused tool for CRI-specific tasks.
- `Cons`:
  - Limited to CRI operations (not a full-featured container CLI).
  - Less intuitive for non-Kubernetes users.
- `Common Use Cases`:
  - Debugging and inspecting runtime issues in Kubernetes clusters.

### 4. Docker CLI

- `Description`:
  - Comprehensive CLI for Docker containers.
- `Pros`:
  - Widely used and mature.
  - Rich ecosystem and feature set.
  - Easy-to-use and highly intuitive.
- `Cons`:
  - Tightly coupled to Docker Engine.
  - Heavy compared to alternatives.

### 5. Podman

- `Description`:
  - A daemonless, Docker-compatible container CLI.
- `Pros`:
  - Rootless mode enhances security.
  - Docker-compatible syntax.
  - Works without a daemon, suitable for lightweight setups.
- `Cons`:
  - Smaller ecosystem compared to Docker.
  - Some compatibility issues with Docker Compose.

### 6. Buildah

- `Description`:
  - A CLI for building OCI-compliant images without requiring a container runtime.
- `Pros`:
  - Lightweight and secure image building.
  - Integrates well with Podman.
- `Cons`:
  - Not a general-purpose container CLI.
  - Steeper learning curve for Docker users.

### 7. LXC CLI (lxc)

- `Description`:
  - CLI for managing LXC containers (system containers).
- `Pros`:
  - Excellent for managing system-level containers.
  - Lightweight and efficient.
- `Cons`:
  - Not suitable for microservices or application-level containerization.

### 8. runc

- `Description`:
  - A low-level CLI for managing OCI-compliant containers.
- `Pros`:
  - Minimal, lightweight, and directly interacts with the runtime.
  - Standardized by the OCI.
- `Cons`:
  - Requires extensive manual configuration.
  - Not user-friendly or feature-rich.

### 9. Singularity

- `Description`:
  - A CLI for managing containers in high-performance computing (HPC) environments.
- `Pros`:
  - Excellent for scientific workloads.
  - Supports running containers without root privileges.
- `Cons`:
  - Niche use case (focused on HPC).
  - Not compatible with CRI or Kubernetes.
