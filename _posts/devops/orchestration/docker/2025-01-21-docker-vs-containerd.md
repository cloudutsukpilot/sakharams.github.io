## Docker vs Containerd

### Container Runtime Interface (CRI)

- The Container Runtime Interface (CRI) is an API that defines the interface between container runtimes (like Docker and Containerd) and container orchestration systems (like Kubernetes).
- It allows container orchestration systems to be agnostic to the underlying container runtime, enabling them to work with different container runtimes interchangeably.

### Open Container Initiative (OCI)

- The Open Container Initiative (OCI) is an open governance structure and project under the Linux Foundation that aims to create open industry standards for container formats and runtime.
- The OCI defines two main specifications: the Image Specification and the Runtime Specification.

1. The `Image Specification` defines the format and structure of container images, including the filesystem layout and metadata.
2. The `Runtime Specification` defines the standard interface between the container runtime and the operating system, specifying how containers should be created, executed, and managed.

### Containerd

- Containerd is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness, and portability.
- CRI compatible.

### Docker

- Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization.
- It allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.
- Docker provides a user-friendly interface (CLI and API) for users to interact with, while containerd operates in the background, handling the lower-level container management tasks.

#### Co-relation between Docker and Containerd

- Docker originally used its own container runtime, called docker, but later it started using containerd as its core container runtime.
- containerd is a component of Docker that is responsible for managing containers, while Docker provides the high-level tooling and user interface on top of it.
