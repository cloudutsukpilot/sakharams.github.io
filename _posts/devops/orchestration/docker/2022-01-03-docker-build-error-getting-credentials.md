#### Introduction:
When working with Docker, you may encounter an error message that says "Error getting credentials" during the build process. This error can be frustrating, but fortunately, there are a few common solutions that can help resolve it.

#### Environment:
Operating System: MacOS
Docker Version: Docker version 25.0.3

#### Error: 
ERROR: failed to solve: alpine:latest: error getting credentials - err: exit status 1, out:

#### Error Description:
The "Error getting credentials" message typically occurs when Docker is unable to retrieve the necessary credentials to authenticate with the Docker registry. This can happen due to various reasons, such as misconfigured authentication settings or issues with the Docker configuration.

Solution 1: Verify Docker Configuration
The first step in troubleshooting this error is to ensure that your Docker configuration is correct. Check the following:

1. Docker Credentials Store: Docker uses a credentials store to securely store and retrieve authentication credentials. Make sure that the credentials store is properly configured and accessible.

2. Docker Configuration File: Check your Docker configuration file (usually located at ~/.docker/config.json) for any misconfigured settings. Pay attention to the "credsStore" and "auths" sections, as they are relevant to authentication.

Solution 2: Reauthenticate
If the issue persists, try reauthenticating with the Docker registry. Follow these steps:

1. Log out of Docker: Run the following command to log out of Docker:
    ```
    docker logout
    ```

2. Log in to Docker: Run the following command to log in to Docker again:
    ```
    docker login
    ```

3. Provide valid credentials: Make sure to provide the correct username and password or any other required authentication details when prompted.

Solution 3: Check Docker Registry Configuration
If the above solutions don't work, it's possible that the issue lies with the Docker registry itself. Verify the following:

1. Registry URL: Ensure that you are using the correct URL for the Docker registry you are trying to authenticate with. Double-check for any typos or incorrect URLs.

2. Registry Authentication: Some Docker registries require additional authentication methods, such as API keys or access tokens. Make sure you are using the correct authentication method for the registry in question.


#### What worked for me:
I removed the the line "credsStore": "desktop" from the located at ~/.docker/config.json, which used the docker login configured in VSCode using username and PAT from dockerhub.

#### Conclusion:
The "Error getting credentials" during Docker login can be resolved by verifying the Docker configuration, reauthenticating, and checking the Docker registry configuration. By following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to overcome this error and continue working with Docker seamlessly.

Remember, troubleshooting Docker errors can sometimes be complex, and the solutions provided here may not cover all possible scenarios. If the issue persists, it's recommended to consult the Docker documentation or seek assistance from the Docker community for further guidance.
