## Docker Issue

### Problem Statement

- Installing Istio using the below commands on a MaCOS:

```sh
curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | ISTIO_VERSION=1.9.0 TARGET_ARCH=x86_64 sh -
cd istio-1.9.0
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
istioctl install --set profile=demo -y
```

- The istiod pods is in crashloopback state with the error "exec format error"

### Error

```sh
exec format error
```

### Reason

- The "exec format error" usually occurs when the shell cannot execute a script due to an issue with its format.

### Solution

- The istio version that was being deployed on the Kubernetes cluster did not support the api version.
