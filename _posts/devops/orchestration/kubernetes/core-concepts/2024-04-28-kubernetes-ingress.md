## Introduction

- Ingress is an API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster. It provides HTTP and HTTPS routing to services based on the request host or path.

### Key features of Ingress

1. **Path-based routing:**
    - Ingress allows you to route traffic to services based on the HTTP URL path. 
    - This means you can route traffic to different services based on the requested URL.

2. **Host-based routing:**
    - You can also route traffic based on the host or domain name in the HTTP request header.

3. **Load balancing:**
    - Ingress can distribute network traffic to multiple pods to ensure no single pod is overwhelmed.

4. **SSL/TLS termination:**
    - Ingress allows you to terminate SSL/TLS encryption at the load balancer before traffic reaches the pods, offloading the encryption overhead from the pods.

5. **Rewriting and redirection:**
    - Ingress rules can rewrite and redirect HTTP requests, changing the URL path before forwarding the request to the service.

### Ingress Controller

- To use Ingress, you need an Ingress controller.
- The Ingress controller is responsible for implementing the Ingress rules and managing the traffic routing.
- There are several third-party Ingress controllers available, such as NGINX, Traefik, and HAProxy.

### Sample YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  backend:
    serviceName: other
    servicePort: 8080
  rules:
  - host: foo.mydomain.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: foo
          servicePort: 8080
  - host: mydomain.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /bar/*
        backend:
          serviceName: bar
          servicePort: 8080

```
