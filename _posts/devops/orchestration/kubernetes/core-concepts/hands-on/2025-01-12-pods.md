description: Lab assignment for creating pods using kubectl
---

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes
- kubectl

## Assignment

- Create a nginx webserver by running a simple pod with a single nginx container

```sh
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
```

- Query our running pods

```sh
kubectl get pods
```

- Check the logs of the pod using the

```sh
kubectl logs pod/nginx
```

- Query the running pods with the -o option to get more information including it's IP address

```sh
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

- Capture the IP address for this pod and confirm that we can ping it from control plane

```sh
NGINX_IP=$(kubectl get pods -o wide | awk '/nginx/ { print $6 }'); echo $NGINX_IP
```

```sh
ping -c 3 $NGINX_IP
```

- We can verify if the pod is accessible from other nodes in the cluster

```sh
ssh <node-name> ping -c 3 $NGINX_IP
```

- You can use port-forward to forward the port on the localhost and access the nginx webpage from the browser

```sh
kubectl port-forward pod/nginx 8080:80
```

- Navigate to http://localhost:8080 and verify that you are able to access the page.

- We can also query the nginx pod by running curl, in another pod and pointing it at the pod IP address -

```sh
kubectl run -it --rm curl --image=curlimages/curl:8.4.0 --restart=Never -- http://$NGINX_IP
```

- You'll see that this pod, automatically cleaned itself after it was run owing to the --rm option -

```sh
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

- Let's explore an alternative approach, we'll run a pod with ubuntu that just runs with sleep infinity, we'll also pass in the variable for our NGINX_IP pod so that it's accessible as an environment variable within the pod -

```sh
kubectl run --image=ubuntu ubuntu --env="NGINX_IP=$NGINX_IP" -- sleep infinity
```

And check that the pod is running -

```sh
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

- We'll now execute a shell process, in the running ubuntu pod

```sh
kubectl exec -it ubuntu -- bash
```

- If we take a look whilst in this shell, we'll see that sleep infinity, is process id 1, we will have our bash shell and then the ps command that we ran, is a subprocess of the bash shell -

```sh
ps -ef
```

- As this is a ubuntu container, we can use the apt package manager to install curl. We will do an apt update, followed by an `apt install -y curl`

```sh
apt update && apt install -y curl
```

- And now we can query the nginx pod, using the NGINX_IP variable that we passed in at the start

```sh
curl $NGINX_IP
```

- Exit from the ubuntu container

```sh
exit
```

- And let's remove these pods

```sh
kubectl delete pod/nginx pod/ubuntu --now
```

- We can use the `kubectl` options of `-o yaml`, along with `--dry-run=client`, to show the yaml declaration that the cli is using, let's tee this to a file called nginx.yaml at the same time

```sh
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml | tee nginx.yaml
```

- Notice the restartPolicy option, if we wish to know more about a particular section of Kubernetes yaml, we can use the `kubectl explain` command. For example, to query this we would use pod (as per the entry Kind), then the path, spec.restartPolicy

```sh
kubectl explain pod.spec.restartPolicy
```

- Let's create this in kubernetes using the imperative approach of `kubectl create` with `-f` to specify the filename

```sh
kubectl create -f nginx.yaml
```

- Whilst this succeeded this time, subsequent attempts will fail as kubectl cannot create an entity that already exists

```sh
kubectl create -f nginx.yaml
```

- An alternative approach is to use the declarative approach of apply, meaning we are applying what this entity should look like. You will get a warning initially if you do this to an entity that was created -

```sh
kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml
```

- However, subsequent attempts will succeed

```sh
kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml
```

- Let's capture a ubuntu pod example, as yaml also, we won't need the NGINX_IP variable

```sh
kubectl run --image=ubuntu --dry-run=client -o yaml ubuntu sleep infinity | tee ubuntu.yaml
```

- Then we also apply this

```sh
kubectl apply -f ubuntu.yaml
```

- And check our pods, we will now have both nginx and ubuntu running successfully, via yaml files

```sh
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

- Let's remove both of these pods

```sh
kubectl delete pod/nginx pod/ubuntu --now
```

- Currently we have two separate files, but a yaml file can contain multiple declarations, let's combine the two files with a --- yaml separator, we will use tee to save this to combined.yaml

```sh
{ cat nginx.yaml; echo "---"; cat ubuntu.yaml; } | tee combined.yaml
```

- If we apply this combined.yaml file, it will create both entities at the same time

```sh
kubectl apply -f combined.yaml
```

- And we can see both pods in our Kubernetes cluster

```sh
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

- We can also use this file to delete both entities, at the same time with the `kubectl delete` command

```sh
kubectl delete -f combined.yaml --now
```

- Modify the combined.yaml file so that we are running a single pod, with two containers, moving the ubuntu containers section, into the nginx section.
- The ubuntu container will be configured as a sidecar that echo's a log and exit's if a file (/tmp/crash) exists.
- We will also update the metadata to match. The following command will create a working example

```sh
cat <<EOF > combined.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: mypod
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: webserver
    resources: {}
  - image: ubuntu
    name: sidecar
    args:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - while true; do echo "\$(date +'%T') - Hello from the sidecar"; sleep 5; if [ -f /tmp/crash ]; then exit 1; fi; done
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
EOF
```

- Apply the new combined.yaml file

```sh
kubectl apply -f combined.yaml
```

- You'll now see that we have a single pod showing 2/2 to indicate that it is running 2 of 2 containers in the pod

```sh
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

- Using kubectl we can describe the pod for further information, in particular the IP address and each of the containers (named webserver and sidecar)

```sh
kubectl describe pod/mypod
```

- Let's capture the mypod IP address

```sh
MYPOD_IP=$(kubectl get pods -o wide | awk '/mypod/ { print $6 }'); echo $MYPOD_IP
```

- And check that this is accessible using a throwaway curl pod (n.b. in the video lesson I used curlimages/curl:latest, this image is found to have frequent changes and instability, therefore for the lab, I've fixed the tag to a known working version)

```sh
kubectl run -it --rm --image=curlimages/curl:8.4.0 --restart=Never curl -- http://$MYPOD_IP
```

- If we check the logs for the sidecar container, we will see this is working as expected, note the use of -c to specify the particular container, ctrl-c to exit

```sh
kubectl logs pod/mypod -c sidecar
```

- Let's crash the sidecar container, by creating the /tmp/crash file that it is looking for as an exit criteria

```sh
kubectl exec -it mypod -c sidecar -- touch /tmp/crash
```

- If we check our pods again, this will transition to a restart of 1, where it restarted the crashed container

```sh
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

- And if we check the sidecar logs, this will have restarted

```sh
kubectl logs pod/mypod -c sidecar
```

- If however, we wish to see the previous logs, we can do so with the -p option

```sh
kubectl logs pod/mypod -p -c sidecar
```

- Let's remove the pod

```sh
kubectl delete pod/mypod --now
```

- And remove the yaml files

```sh
rm nginx.yaml ubuntu.yaml combined.yaml
```
