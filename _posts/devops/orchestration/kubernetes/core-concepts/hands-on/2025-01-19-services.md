### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes
- kubectl

### Assignment

- Lets start by creating a deployment and exposing it as a service using different options.

### Deployment

```sh
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --port=80 --replicas=3 -o yaml --dry-run=client
```

```sh
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --port=80 --replicas=3
```

### ClusterIP Service

1️⃣  Create a simple deployment using nginx and expose it on port 80 with 3 replicas.

```sh
kubectl expose deployment/nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

```sh
kubectl expose deployment/nginx
```

2️⃣ Check the exposed services and endpoints on the kubernetes cluster. Note that all the endpoints relate to the nginx pods ip addresses.

```sh
kubectl get services
```

```sh
kubectl get endpoints
```

```sh
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

3️⃣ Capture the Cluster IP and access the exposed service using curl.

```sh
CLUSTER_IP=$(kubectl get services | grep ClusterIP | grep nginx | awk {'print $3'}); echo $CLUSTER_IP
```

```sh
curl $CLUSTER_IP
```

4️⃣ Try accessing the service from another pod and check the DNS search path relating to the service.

```sh
kubectl run --rm -it curl --image=curlimages/curl:8.4.0 --restart=Never -- sh
```

```sh
curl nginx.default.svc.cluster.local
```

```sh
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

```sh
curl nginx
```

```sh
exit
```

5️⃣ Delete the service.

```sh
kubectl delete service/nginx
```

### NodePort Service

1️⃣ Expose the service using NodePort and verify that two ports are listed - Application and NodePort.

```sh
kubectl expose deployment/nginx --type=NodePort
```

```sh
kubectl get service
```

2️⃣ Capture the Cluster IP and the NodePort to query the NodePort service from one of the nodes.

```sh
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

```sh
CONTROL_PLANE_IP=$(kubectl get nodes -o wide | grep control-plane | awk {'print $6'}); echo $CONTROL_PLANE_IP
```

```sh
NODEPORT_PORT=$(kubectl get services | grep NodePort | grep nginx | awk -F'[:/]' '{print $2}'); echo $NODEPORT_PORT
```

```sh
curl ${CONTROL_PLANE_IP}:${NODEPORT_PORT}
```

3️⃣ Delete the NodePort service.

```sh
kubectl delete service/nginx
```

### LoadBalancer Service

1️⃣ Expose the deployment using the LoadBalancer service type.

```sh
kubectl expose deployment/nginx --type=LoadBalancer --port 8080 --target-port 80
```

```sh
kubectl get service
```

2️⃣ Capture the IP address and the port and query the nginx service to check how the load balancer routes the query to different pods.

```sh
LOADBALANCER_IP=$(kubectl get service | grep LoadBalancer | grep nginx | awk '{split($0,a," "); split(a[4],b,","); print b[1]}'); echo $LOADBALANCER_IP
```

```sh
LOADBALANCER_PORT=$(kubectl get service | grep LoadBalancer | grep nginx | awk -F'[:/]' '{print $2}'); echo $LOADBALANCER_PORT
```

```sh
watch --differences "curl ${LOADBALANCER_IP}:${LOADBALANCER_PORT} 2>/dev/null"
```

3️⃣ Delete the LoadBalancer service

```sh
kubectl delete deployment/nginx service/nginx
```

### ExternalName Service

1️⃣ Create two deployments with different images.

```sh
kubectl create deployment nginx-red --image=spurin/nginx-red --port=80
```

```sh
kubectl create deployment nginx-blue --image=spurin/nginx-blue --port=80
```

```sh
kubectl get deployment
```

2️⃣ Expose both the deployments as a service.

```sh
kubectl expose deployment/nginx-red
```

```sh
kubectl expose deployment/nginx-red
```

```sh
kubectl get service
```

3️⃣ Create an ExternalName service of my-service that points to nginx-red pod.

```sh
kubectl create service externalname my-service --external-name nginx-red.default.svc.cluster.local
```

```sh
kubectl get service
```

4️⃣ Spin up a new pod and curl all the services. Notice that the ExternalName service points to nginx-red pod.

```sh
kubectl run --rm -it curl --image=curlimages/curl:8.4.0 --restart=Never -- sh
```

```sh
curl nginx-red
````

```sh
curl nginx-blue
```

```sh
curl my-service
```

```sh
nslookup my-service
```

5️⃣ In another tab, edit the server `my-service` and update it to point to nginx-blue.

```sh
kubectl edit service/my-service
```

6️⃣ In the original tab where we have ssh'ed into the curl container, check the my-service resolution.

```sh
nslookup my-service
```

```sh
curl my-service
```

```sh
exit
```

7️⃣ Cleanup the deployment and service for ExternalName service.

```sh
kubectl delete deployment/nginx-blue deployment/nginx-red service/nginx-blue service/nginx-red service/my-service
```

### Headless Service

1️⃣ Create a nignx deployment with 3 replicas.

```sh
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=spurin/nginx-debug --replicas=3 --port=80
```

2️⃣ Create a headless service by modifying the ClusterIP yaml declaration and apply the changes.

```sh
kubectl expose deployment/nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml --type=ClusterIP | tee headless.yaml
```

```sh
grep -q 'clusterIP: None' headless.yaml || sed -i '/spec:/a\ \ clusterIP: None' headless.yaml; cat headless.yaml
```

```sh
kubectl apply -f headless.yaml 
```

3️⃣ Verify if the headless service was created successfully.

```sh
kubectl get service
```

4️⃣ Run the curl pod and note the IP address that are reference while we curl the headless service.

```sh
kubectl run --rm -it curl --image=curlimages/curl:8.4.0 --restart=Never -- sh
```

```sh
watch nslookup nginx
```

```sh
curl nginx
```

```sh
exit
```

5️⃣ Remove the headless service.

```sh
rm headless.yaml; kubectl delete deployment/nginx service/nginx
```
