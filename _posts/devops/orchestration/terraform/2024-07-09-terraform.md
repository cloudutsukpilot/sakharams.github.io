## Introduction

- Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. 
- It allows you to define and provision infrastructure resources in a declarative manner. 
- With Terraform, you can manage resources across various cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services(AWS), Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, as well as on-premises infrastructure.

### Key Features

1. **Desired State**
    - One of the key features of Terraform is its ability to create a "desired state" for your infrastructure.
    - You define the desired state in a Terraform configuration file, which is written in a domain-specific language (DSL) called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).
    - The configuration file describes the resources you want to create, their properties, and any dependencies between them.

2. **Dependency Graph**
    - Terraform uses a dependency graph to determine the order in which resources should be created or modified.
    - It automatically handles the provisioning and configuration of resources, ensuring that they are created in the correct order and that any dependencies are satisfied.

3. **Infrastructure as Code**
    - Another powerful feature of Terraform is its support for infrastructure as code principles.
    - By defining your infrastructure in code, you can version control it, apply best practices for code review and testing, and collaborate with others more effectively.
    - This makes it easier to manage and scale your infrastructure over time.

4. **Plugins**
    - Terraform also provides a rich ecosystem of providers, which are plugins that allow you to interact with different cloud providers and services.
    - These providers abstract away the differences between cloud APIs, allowing you to write infrastructure code that is portable across different environments.
    - In addition to managing infrastructure resources, Terraform can also be used to manage other aspects of your infrastructure lifecycle, such as creating and managing DNS records, configuring load balancers, and deploying applications.
