## Introduction

- To get started with GCP using Terraform, we can follow these steps:

1. **Install Terraform**
    - Download and install Terraform from the official Terraform website.

2. **Install Google Cloud SDK**
    - Download and install the Google Cloud SDK.

3. **Authenticate with Google Cloud**
    - Run `gcloud auth login` to authenticate your Google Cloud account.

4. **Set your project**
    - Run `gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]` to set the GCP project.

5. **Create a Service Account**
    - Go to the Google Cloud Console and navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts.
    - Create a new service account and download the JSON key file.

6. Set Up Terraform Configuration:
    - Create a main.tf file with the following content:

    ```terraform
    provider "google" {
      credentials = file("path/to/your-service-account-file.json")
      project     = "your-project-id"
      region      = "us-central1"
    }

    resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
      name         = "test-instance"
      machine_type = "e2-medium"
      zone         = "us-central1-a"

      boot_disk {
        initialize_params {
          image = "debian-cloud/debian-9"
        }
      }

      network_interface {
        network = "default"

        access_config {
        }
      }
    }
    ```

7. Initialize and Apply Terraform Configuration:
    - Run `terraform init` to initialize the configuration.
    - Run `terraform apply` and follow the prompts to create resources.
