## Introduction

- DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) provides a standard set of DevOps metrics used for evaluating process performance and maturity. 
- These metrics provide information about how quickly DevOps can respond to changes, the average time to deploy code, the frequency of iterations, and insight into failures.

### DORA Metrics Tools

1. **LinearB**
    - LinearB works with your Git, project management, incident, and release management tools to generate a DORA metrics dashboard quickly and easily for teams and the entire organization.
    - Beyond DORA metrics, LinearB can monitor additional KPIs that contribute to your company’s success.
    - Keep tabs on crucial leading indicators like pull request (PR) size, PR review depth, PR review time, and the amount of time from deployment to production.
    - Improve key metrics and positively influence deployment frequency and lead time for changes.
    - Measure your software delivery performance with our Engineering Benchmarks, so you can see how you stack up to data-backed industry standards.
    - Dashboard displaying DORA metrics you can use to showcase engineering health.

2. **Cortex**
    - Cortex is a helpful DORA metrics tool if you’re looking to better understand and refine your solutions, but it has limitations when it comes to extensive customization and scaling. 
    - Cortex offers several integrations, but some users may find it lacks the flexibility needed for complex team structures. 
    - Additionally, the reliance on CQL expressions can be challenging for users who are not familiar with query languages.

    - `Pros`: Offers integrations and customizations to track DORA metrics out of the box.
    - `Cons`: Limited flexibility for extensive customization and requires familiarity with CQL expressions, which can be a barrier for some users.

3. **CTO.ai**
    - CTO.ai offers DevOps as a Service, and they begin their implementation by measuring your DORA Metrics. 
    - CTO.ai’s Insights offers actionable data about your teams’ performance, but is best suited for smaller teams or those just starting out with DORA metrics. 
    - The platform's capabilities may be insufficient for larger teams requiring extensive integrations and more advanced reporting. 

    - `Pros`: Consolidated view of workload data across time with actionable insights.
    - `Cons`: Limited scalability for larger engineering teams and fewer advanced reporting options compared to other tools.

4. **Apache DevLake**
    - Apache DevLake is an open-source tool designed to provide insights into your engineering processes by integrating data from multiple sources. 
    - While it offers extensive customization and flexibility, the downside is that it requires manual maintenance and upkeep to build DORA Metrics dashboards.
    - `Pros`: Highly customizable and flexible due to its open-source nature.
    - `Cons`: Requires manual maintenance and lacks dedicated support, which can be challenging for teams without the necessary resources.

5. **Sleuth**
    - Sleuth is an operating system that highlights DORA Metrics as a key part of their platform. 
    - For teams that want to try Sleuth’s free DORA offering, you will run into limits on the number of users and repositories which will restrict you from deriving meaningful insights without upgrading to a paid version. 
    - `Pros`: Real-time tracking of deployments and bottlenecks.
    - `Cons`: Limitations in the free version, missing capabilities and visualizations in the paid version.

6. **Jira**
    - Jira is a project management tool that helps teams plan, track, and manage their workflows. 
    - With plugins like Velocity, Jira Align, and other third-party add-ons, Jira can be extended to track DORA metrics by connecting development and deployment data.  
    - However, Jira's effectiveness for tracking DORA metrics heavily depends on integrating multiple plugins, which can make the setup complex and costly.

    - `Pros`: Allows for Deployment Frequency, Lead Time, Change Failure Rate, and MTTR tracking through plugins and custom dashboards.
    - `Cons`: Complex setup and maintenance due to reliance on multiple plugins, inconsistent data if teams do not update tickets properly, and potential additional costs for necessary plugins.

7. **GitLab**
    - GitLab is a DevOps platform that offers source control management, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment monitoring. 
    - It has built-in capabilities to track DORA metrics, but it can but it can lack granularity and customization.

    - `Pros`: Automatically tracks all four DORA metrics with integrated CI/CD pipelines, providing real-time insights and metrics dashboards.
    - `Cons`: Lacks granularity and customization, may require external tools for deeper incident analysis.

8. **Datadog**
    - Datadog is a monitoring and observability platform that helps teams track their applications' and infrastructure's performance and health. 
    - While it’s not specifically designed for DevOps metrics, it can track DORA metrics by integrating with CI/CD and incident management tools. 
    - Setting up Datadog for DORA metrics involves configuring multiple custom dashboards and integrations, which can be complex and costly.

    - `Pros`: Excels at monitoring MTTR and Change Failure Rate, with customizable dashboards and seamless integrations.
    - `Cons`: Limited native support for DORA metrics, high cost as more features are added, and a steep learning curve for custom dashboard configurations.

9. **CircleCI**
    - CircleCI is a CI/CD platform commonly used to track deployment frequency and lead time as part of continuous delivery practices. 
    - However, CircleCI’s capabilities for tracking the complete DORA metrics set are limited, and teams may need additional tools to get a full picture.

    - `Pros`: Tracks Deployment Frequency and Lead Time, with easy integration options and reusable configuration packages (orbs).
    - `Cons`: Lacks native incident management capabilities, and metrics may lack the granularity needed for more complex environments.

10. **Pluralsight Flow**
    - Pluralsight Flow provides visibility into engineering efficiency, including DORA metrics, but it comes with some downsides. 

    - `Pros`: Detailed reporting on DORA metrics and advanced visualizations.
    - `Cons`: Steep learning curve and complex setup process, which may be daunting for teams looking for quick implementation.

11. **Swarmia**
    - Swarmia is a software engineering intelligence platform tool that focuses on data-driven insights, including DORA metrics. 
    -Swarmia’s value can be limited by its integration options and lacks integration with several popular developer tools like GitLab, Shortcut, and Azure DevOps.
    - `Pros`: Focuses on key DORA metrics and offers goal-setting capabilities.
    - `Cons`: Integration limitations and user restrictions make it impractical for larger teams without upgrading to a paid plan.

12. **Jellyfish**
    - Jellyfish helps engineering leaders understand team performance by providing insights into DORA metrics, team efficiency, and delivery cycles. 
    - Although Jellyfish integrates with Git, project management tools, and incident management platforms, setup often requires more vendor-supported customization and hands-on configuration from engineering teams.
    - `Pros`: Tracks DORA metrics alongside additional engineering KPIs, identifies bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
    - `Cons`: Limited customization for advanced needs, potentially high cost for larger organizations, more time to configure. 

13. **GetDX**
    - GetDX is an engineering intelligence platform that provides insights into engineering metrics, including DORA metrics, with a focus on improving developer experience.
    - The tool integrates with existing systems, but requires additional setup to connect with all the necessary data sources, and the customization capabilities can be limiting for teams that need more control over their metrics. 
    - `Pros`: Focused on developer experience, provides DORA metrics tracking.
    - `Cons`: Requires setup to connect data sources, limited customization options, lack of granularity with quantitative metrics.
