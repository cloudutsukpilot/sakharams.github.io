I began my career with Office 365 and Microsoft Exchange, offering expert guidance to Microsoft customers by understanding their issues and providing solutions. Later, I transitioned to working with database technologies such as MS SQL and Postgres, automating daily operations for database engineers. For the past 8 years, I have continuously learned various cloud and DevOps technologies (listed below) and gained hands-on experience through multiple projects.


In my spare time I like to go on short day cycle trips to enjoy the weather and stay fit. The maximum distance that I have been able to acheive in a trip was 80 kms.
